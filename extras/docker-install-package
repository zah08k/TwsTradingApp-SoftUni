I should add any new package I need to requirements.txt file. Example:

pandas==2.0.3

Rebuild the Docker image. I can do this with the

docker-compose up --build

command. This tells Docker to rebuild my image, which includes installing the packages listed in requirements.txt file.

When installing plotly, I pip installed it, added it to requirements.txt and performed docker-compose up --build.
However, it was not installed in the celery, celery-beat and web containers. So I did the following for all of the 3
containers:

docker exec -it [container id] /bin/bash
python
pip install plotly


NOTE: I tried the same for ibapi, but I didn't have to type 'python' but instead 'pip install ibapi' straight away
